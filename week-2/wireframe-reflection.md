What Is A Wireframe?
A wireframe is a detailed visual layout for your website. It's a huge part of the planning phase of your website where you essentially draw exactly what you would like the webpage to look like. If it's done on a program that converts well it should make it easier for you when you're adding the code.

Benefits?
As stated previously wireframing allows you to convert your images from say Illustrator to Photoshop easily so that all you have to do is apply the code to the blocks where you would like for example links to lead to. Also it gives you a well planned website to work with and build from, as well as giving you something to show to whomever you're designing for as a prototype. Once you have a prototype you can get feedback and begin the path to collaborating on a website with whomever you're creating it for.

Did you enjoy?
I really liked wireframing a website. It gave me a new look into how professionals get their websites done. This whole time I figured that people more or less had the code in their heads and knew what they wanted to do and free formed it. Boy was I wrong. It actually made me feel a lot better and more confident going into future assignments.

Revise?
I revised my blog post wireframe. Mostly because my initial idea was to have the website display the posts, then as you went to the bottom of the page add more posts, similar to tumblr. Unfortunately that wasn't possible with what we're learning with CSS and HTML, so I had to redesign the website with links in mind as opposed to posts. No biggie though.

Questions?
I was always curious on the proper way to set up a website. I actually asked one of my friends who does graphic design and they explained that there's three levels to every photo and if you work those layers properly it's appealing to the eyes. Also I did independent research on User Experience to see how a well flowing website can lead to more traffic.

Did I like?
My favorite part of the assignment was designing the actual wireframes because as an adult it's pretty rare I get to work with a pen and straight edge. It actually made me feel really happy, like I was using a coloring book with my inner 6 year old.  The only tedious part about this was understanding that the wireframes I wrote, I'll probably have to redo in a program and become familiar with it to make this process easier in the future.
