    Translating my previous learning on HTML to an actual website was pretty difficult. Less so in the sense of actually doing the work, but moreso because I figured that because I'd finished Codecademy's HTML/CSS section already, I figured I'd breeze through it. This was definitely a great eye opener for me to let me know that I still have a ways to go.

    Researching HTML5 elements were pretty fun. I'd had experience with Dreamweaver and creating websites a loooooong time ago, and it was really interesting to see how things have changed since. It's a lot of information available on HTML5 to the public and I think it's great because it allows you to learn more if you'd like.

    Keeping to best practices wasn't really too difficult. I'm kind of used to writing code a certain way and it looks like it works in conjuction with what we're learning here.

    The best thing about HTML that I've learned thus far is it is useful with other coding platforms. You can apply the logic of Ruby, Java, etc. to HTML and create amazing websites. On the downside because we're not there yet, our websites are kind of limited.

    When remembering to write HTML I just remember that everything that starts with a <> ends with a </> and if that code is missing, your site wont run correctly. It's a really small detail but I find it's overlooked often cause it's tedious, but once more, I can't stress it's importance enough.
