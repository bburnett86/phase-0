# H1
The most useful method I learned about today was the Pomodoro method. I personally thought that this technique was most interesting because I'd used a technique similar to this previously to help me memorize poems. We would work on repeating the poems for about 15 minutes for a time take a break and get back to it, I found that my mind was able to process more information than if I attempted to "cram" study. I think this specifically will assist me with studying code in order to make sure I'm absorbing information while keeping me fresh. I also intend to utilize time boxing as well. I believe Time Boxing will really assist me with managing how much I currently Uber Drive. As opposed to having a monetary goal for the day, I feel like being able to work a set amount of hours and gauge my progress will let me realize the most effective times to drive thus lowering my stress and boosting productivity. I'm really excited I to be able to apply these techniques to my life.

## H2
Learning about the command line was really an eye opening experience. Getting to see all the functions a computer does manually through the command line was actually a lot more interesting than I initially figured it would be. But, I suppose the best way to display what I've learned would be to answer the questions, thus, literally, displaying what I've learned

pwd - determines where you are in the command line

ls - list all files and directories

mv - move and rename items in the command line

cp - copy a file

cd - navigates between directories

touch - allows you to create  new file in the terminal

mkdir- allows you to create new directories 

less/MORE - allows you to look inside files

rmdir- deletes directories using the command line

rm - deletes files using the command line

help - allows you to access help via the command line

(Not sure what other detail was wanted for this one other than proof the information was obtained, feel free to give me plenty of feedback)

### H3
In this session we took a more in depth look into Github and learned about repositories. Forking repositories allows you to create a version of the file that you will be able to work on independently during group work. This works wonderfully during group work as it allows you a version to work on that is independent from the master, so you can work on it and test things without effecting the rest of the group who may be working on it as well.
