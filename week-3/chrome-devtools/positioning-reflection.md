Using DevTools is really great in helping you format your code. Being able to see it as such next to the actual code in the branch allows you to get a better understanding not only of how things fit together but allows you to see if there's any errors in your code, and where they apply. Also, it allows you to see what other people did on their websites so if you'd like to do something similar you can reference their code (if available).

You would resize elements in the DOM using CSS either via the font-size attribute which would allow you to change all the size of the text in a certain selector (<p>,<h1>,<table>, etc). Otherwise if you were trying to change the size of div objects you'd do so using their top/bottom/right/left or giving a percentage to their height or width.

Relative positioning means the items position will be relative to the other items it is associated with. For example if you have 5 items on row and one item is set to be positioned relatively lower than the rest only that item will be affected and it'll be effected relative to the other items there. Absolute positioning is exactly that. If an object is positioned absolutely then no matter what other objects are there that object will appear on top of them. It's always going to be there no matter what, it's as I like to think of, an absolute truth. Fixed positioning is similar to absolute where the item will appear over any other items in the code. The difference with Fixed is that the items will stay in that exact same location on the page no matter how much you scroll. The sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative positioning and fixed. This item will stay in the same place on the screen as you scroll, but unlike fixed, there's a thresh hold where the fixed positioning stops applying.

The margin is the transparent part of an object that can more or less be identified as the space between objects. The border is the outside of the object which can be transparent, and it can also have different designs whether it's dashed, solid, etc. The border gives you the actual outline of the object as well. Padding is the space between the content and the border.

This was probably the easiest challenge I've done thus far. Mostly because if you'd gone through the codecademy everything was already covered. Also, although I'm not sure I have a perfect understanding of all the elements I used, I do understand how to create and position various parts of HTML code now.
