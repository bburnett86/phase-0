1.5 Reflections

Commit is used to save your progress where you are, and also can be used as a starting point from that place if you mess up and would like to go back to your last save before any errors occurred. In order to commit messages you want to first make sure that everything is added, and that your branch is as close as up to date with the master as possible. At which point you merge the files. So essetially after you create a change you would add the file, check the status of the file, and push the file if it's where/what you want. The most useful part of Github is being able to Push and Pull items. You would want to pull an item to see what your partner may have been working on in order to check their work, assist them with a problem, and most importantly make sure you haven't been working on the same feature before you try to merge the items in to the origin branch. You never want to effect the origin branch until you are completely sure that you have the code you want to use.

1.1 Think About Time Reflection
I learned primarily about the Pomodoro technique where you study for 25 minutes then take a five minute break. I really feel like this is a great technique to keep you engaged with your studies as it allows you time to take a small breather and give your brain and body a quit reboot.

Time Boxing is where you set a specific amount of time to accomplish a task. For example if you have a year to do a large project you want to break that project up into pieces. Each piece has a specific designated amount of time for you to do the best you can on that portion. When it's done you move on to the next portion. This way you avoid rabbit holes and your project gets finished on time.

Currently I've been using something similar to the Pomodoro method except I'll generally study for an hour and a half and break for 30 minutes. This technique is good for me as it allows me to execute a lot of work in a specific time block. However, sometimes I do daydream or become unengaged because I've been working for a while. However, when I come back from my break I'm usually good for one more session until I'm finished for a few hours.

I'll attempt to employ the Pomodoro method over the time period's I'd normally use in conjunction with what I'm currently doing to see which is most successful.

My current plan for Phase 0 time management is breaking the assignments up by their suggested length and having certain amounts of modules I'd like to do in a day dependent on their size. This also requires a bit of planning as I should know what I'll be expecting to accomplish a week in advance to plan.

1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A Shell is a traditional Unix interface that allows command line user interface. Bash on the other hand IS a unix shell but it's an update. It was written as a free software replacement and is actually used on most operating systems to this day (in my case Terminal).

The most challenging thing throughout the material really has been adjusting my thinking to using my computer without picture. It's not really something hard to do, as I expected programming would be text based, but, it's also refreshing to have a reminder that everything we're using today was just words on a screen before.

Also, all of the commands on the lists I tried and they worked successfully! Personally I believe the most important commands and arguments to know would be the ones you'll use most. So more than likely mkdir, touch, ls, pwd, and cd.

-pwd
Prints working directory
-ls
Lists Directory
-mv
Moves a file or directory
-cd
Changes Directory
-../
Informs you if you're in a directory
-touch
Creates new file
-mkdir
Creates new directory
-less
Allows you to page through a file
-rmdir
Removes a directory
-rm
Removes a file
-help
Allows you to inquire the function of things available to use.

1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
How To Create A New Repo:

If you would like to create a new repository on Github, the first thing you would do is log into your Github profile. You can actually, consider this the first step for all the "How To"s going forward. After you're logged in on the right side of the navigation bar you're going to see a plus (+) sign. You want to click on that sign and choose to create "New Repository". After the repository is created you name it, decide whether you'd like to make it private or public, choose it's licensing, and click on the green button on the bottom left hand side that says Create Repository. And that's it, repository created.

How To Fork a Repo:

After you're logged in, suppose you see something interesting on Github that's public that you would like to use. Well, on that page, on the top right hand side directly below the navigational bar you'll see a "Fork" button with a number after it (the number of times it's been forked). If you belong to a lot of different GitHub Organizations you even get the opportunity to choose where the repository is forked to. Once it's been forked you'll be directed to the Github Copy on your profile.

How To Clone a Repo:

Once you're logged in, if you see something that you would like to be able to use on your local computer. The first thing that you would like to do would be clone that repository. In order to do this, you must locate the SHH clone url in the right sidebar. After you've located that copy it in it's entirety ( command + A then command + C). After it's copied open up your command line (in my case terminal). Within there you would like to input

git clone [Paste what you just copied]

At which point you'll more or less have that file copied to wherever it is in your computer that you were on the terminal line. Make sure you pwd to check your location before hand.

Why Forking?

The benefits of forking a repository are definitely that you're able to have your own global copy of the file on the internet. You'd be able to reference that file easily from your Github account whenever you signed in and keep any of your edits online in that space. Which is the benefits over just looking over the file whenever you'd like to use it. It's also nice to do that instead of directly cloning because you can make sure that you have your digital path ready and then clone it from your account.

Github issues?

I didn't have any issues setting up github. I initially set up Github in a class that was Ruby focused and we had a walk through with a tutor. It wasn't really that difficult at all, but that also may be because I had additional help.
