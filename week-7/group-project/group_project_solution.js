// I would like this program to take input that would be a series of numbers.
// From that input I would like program to be able to run several different mathematical operations with those numbers.
  //I will first need somethnig that will make sure that there are several initial qualities for this program to work
    // In order to run the program must have the qualities of a test, a message, and a test number. If it is no test, the program will return an error.
    // After all the initial qualities have been confirmed the program will use those qualities to determine what tests will be run on which set of numbers.
    // The first operation I would like to run is a sum operation.
      // First it will test to make sure that sum is availble in the code to use as an operation.
      // After it's complete it will be able to return the sum of all the numbers with an odd length from the numbers given to you.
      // It will also be able to give you the sum of all the numbers with an even length as well.
    // The next operation I would like to run is a mean operation.
      // The mean operation will add all of the numbers and take an average of them.
      // The program will once more check for the function, after which it will be able to execute the code on the even and odd number lengths.
    // The final operation I would like to perform is the median operation.
      // The median is literally a matter of finding the middle most number in a set of numbers.
      // The code will first check to make sure there is an operation for this, and then proceed to run the code.
