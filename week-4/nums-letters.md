What does puts do?

Puts will print out the answer to the console on a new line, but it will return nil. Meaning, if you need that answer for whatever reason later in the program it will not be available for you. If you would like to be able to print information to the console and have that information available to you later in the equation then you would use p instead of puts.

What is an Integer? What is a float? What's the difference?

An integer is any whole number. Literally, any whole number you can think of. I specify whole because a float is a whole number with number attatched after a decimal. So for example. 4 is an integer. 4.5 is a float. Floats of course can be really useful for things like percentages and other math related tasks. Also if you have no coding reference I always would just explain to someone that an integer is any number written without a decimal point, and a float would be a number written with one, even if it didn't need it.
