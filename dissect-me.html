		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>Welcome to HTML Anatomy 101. In this class, you will do the
		learn how to dissect an HTML page from the <head> to the <footer>, add a new feature to Sublime Text, and mark up your previous blog posts with semantic HTML tags. So get your gloves on, open your textbook (the HTML docs (Links to an external site.)) and begin!</p>

	<section>
		<h2>Release 0: Set up</h2>
		<p>Decide who will drive and who will navigate. Then each of you will need to:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Create a feature branch in the phase-0 directory</li>
			<li>Using the command line, navigate to the week-3 directory</li>
			<li>Within that directory, (using the command line) create a blank HTML page called dissect-me.html.</li>
			<li>Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Create a quick pull request and merge the changes. </li>
			<li>SUBMIT your link to the dissect-me.html file as soon as you do this. This is how your guide will give you feedback. The URL should be something like: https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html (Links to an external site.)</li>

	<footer>NOTE: You should decide whether to trade roles in each release or change roles halfway through the session. If you decide to switch from release to release, you'll want to share code easily using a collaborative editor (or even a simple Google doc).

	What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	The DOCTYPE will continue to get used as it notifies the browser we'll be utilizing HTML as the document type. Also the <HTML> tags get used in order to let the document know that withen those tags everything should be interpreted as HTML. The head is essential as it includes all the priliminary information that isn't necessarily content (i.e. the title tag which shows up in the tab in the website but not  on the actual site). The <main> tags let us know what part of the code we're writing will be the main content. the header lets us know what the initial head (top) of the page will look like. The <H1...> tags notate individual heading by importance. The <p> notifies us that text is about to be grouped into a paragraph. The section tag lets us know that we have individual sections to a webpage that will be there that should be able to be understood independently. The <ul> tag designates an unorganized list which essentially puts bullet points before the list items which is the <li> tag. Lastly the footer tag lets us know the end of the webpage information that's usually informative in regards to who made the website, last updates, etc.

	How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	Elements get laid out on a page by which semantic elements you choose to associate with them. For example a <nav> tag would mean that  something would be expected to be a set of links that went across in a thin straight line. Not that you necessarily would have to include that within your nav tag for the code to be functional, but when coming back and reading the code having good tags makes it a lot easier to understand. Also, the Browser will use certain things from the semantic elements to help decide where various things go. For example the <aside> tag is mostly meant for things that will go on the side later. Although we cannot readily do this with just HTML when we learn more about CSS I've been told it'll be much easier for us.

	What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
	This challenge I learned that Sublime Text 2 actually allows you to create your own shortcuts called snippets. I hadn't known previously about what happens when you type html then press tag (extreme time saver) which was a good segway into snippets. I think I'd like to create more snippets at a later date. Specifically for things that will involve lots of repetition (i.e. unordered lists, a href, etc.) -->
